## What is a Magic cube?
In mathematics, a magic cube is the 3-dimensional equivalent of a magic square, that is, a number of integers arranged in a n × n × n pattern such that the sums of the numbers on each row, on each column, on each pillar and on each of the four main space diagonals are equal to the same number, the so-called magic constant of the cube. [*wikipedia page!*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_cube)
## What is magiccube?
__magiccube__ is a basic program to create rows, containing random sequences of characters with a set length of columns,
where each row and each column includes characters, which occur only once at maximum.
## How to use it?
* Inside __magiccube.py__ there is a line starting with __*alpha*__, just add your choice of characters to that line using an unicode string, which can be created by using the prefix **u** like this:
`alpha = u'0123456789'`  
After that just run the program and specify the length of output table by giving a number.
